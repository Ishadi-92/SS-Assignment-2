# SS-Assignment-2

Here I have uploaded all the php files I created and used. (config.php, index.php, g-callback.php, login.php, logout.php)
Also I have added images.rar file and GoogleAPI.rar file. 

Testing :
Download all these php files and two zip files.(Extract the php files). Add all the files in the xampp server, htdocs (folder).
Run the xampp server and test the funtions in your browser with localhost.
